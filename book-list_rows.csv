1,Going Infinite: (The rise and fall of a new tycoon),Michael Lewis,1/11/2024,1/14/2024,5,Patrick Kennedy,"I always enjoy Michael Lewis books.  He has done his usual great job of writing an entertaining and insightful book here.  The subject of the book in Sam Bankman Fried and the rise and fall of FTX, a crypto-currency trading platform.   The story winds through Sam as a weird kid, whose only friends are from Math Club, through his educational experiences and then into his working career.  He was recruited from MIT into a trading firm called Jane Street Capital where is was his job to price ETF funds based on the value 

The training process that the new recruits were put through in Jane Street capital was interesting.  Effectively they were encouraged and coached in how to make bets and markets all through there training.  The process rewarded those who could make reasonably good expected value calculations quickly and with limited information.  The book documents Frieds personality quirks including, lack of empathy, inability to show emotions (he had to practice making facial expressions) and his addictive game playing.  The rest of the story is about the details of rise and fail of FTX and Alameda, his crypto trading companies.

Very interesting and in some ways disturbing read.

2,Sapiens,Yuval Harari,3/26/2023,3/20/2023,4,Patrick Kennedy,"This was an interesting book that tried to take a logical and evolutionarily driven approach to the howâ€™s and whyâ€™s humans have evolved the way they have.  The author is a secular, gay Israeli, so his opinions would be pretty left of center.  I did not agree with all of his thesis or follow the same line of reasoning, but the book was an interesting read.  ",0,0
3,The Alignment Problem (Machine Learning and Human Values),Brian Christian,12/20/2022,2/3/2023,5,Patrick Kennedy,"This is a 5 star book.  The author is a very good story teller and he weaves interesting stories about the different major intellectual accomplishments associated with the development of Artificial Intelligence in a delightful way throughout the book.  This book could be thought of as a tutorial on how AI systems work.  It does a great job of outlining the theoretical concepts associated with different types of machine learning algorithms, some of the history and challenges associated with the various algorithms and what problems they are useful at solving.  But the book could also be seen as a history of the study of how humans learn.  The algorithms and strategies used to develop AI are in many cases directly copied or adapted from studies of how people learn.  There are as many quotes and discussions of the study of human learning as there are of machines.  Additionally, the book discusses some of the ethical and a safety concerns with AI",0,14
4,The Undoing Project,Michael Lewis,12/15/2022,12/19/2022,5,Patrick Kennedy,"I am actually not sure when I started this book so I put approximate dates.  This book is about Danny Kahneman and Amos Tversky.  Danny Kahneman wrote a book called “Thinking Fast and Slow”.  To be honest, I have started the book several times and not finished it.  Not because it is hard to read (although it is not light reading) but because (I think!) That there is so much good information and insights in every page that it is hard to digest.  In any case, Michael Lewis, as he usually does, has put together a very nice, well written and page turning story about these two gentlemen.  They are two Israeli psychologist, who fought in many of the Israeli wars and who assisted the IDF in many aspects of psychology related to decision making, statistics and how people think.   The story of these two guys alone is pretty interesting but it also describes how they worked together and how they went about their investigations.  I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it",0,
5,"Title: Code Breaker; Jennifer Doudna, Gene Editing and the Future of the human race.",Walter Isaacson,2/3/2023,2/14/2023,5,Patrick Kennedy,"This was a very interesting book, about a fascinating and a bit scary topic.  Jennifer Doudna is a biochemist, who won the 2020 Nobel prize in chemistry.  She and her collaborator Emmanuelle Charpentier won the Nobel Prize for the CRISPR tool.  This is a tool that made it easy and cheap to edit DNA.  The story is about how she worked to develop it, but also about all the other competitors at the time were also working to do similar work and how that competition went.  That was also a very interesting part of the story.  The story also goes into some of the ways that people are using this technology.  These kits can be bought for less than $1000 and people can use them to edit there own DNA and then inject it back into their bloodstream and there are DNA “hacking” clubs that do this. This is an interesting article about the technology.",0,3
6,The Double Helix,James Watson,2/15/2023,3/1/2023,5,Patrick Kennedy,"I read this book after I finished with Code Breaker.  It was written by James Watson, the co-discoverer of the double helix structure of DNA.  A good read and interesting read, but this would have to be topic that you were interested in to get a lot out of it.  I am not as well versed in Biology as I would like to be and I thought this would give me some insights.  It did, however I still can’t say that I have a good grasp of how this works.  I think I would have been better off with a textbook.",0,3
7,A Brave New World,Aldous Huxley,2/17/2023,2/25/2023,4,Patrick Kennedy,"I wanted to start reading a bit more fiction and this is on several lists as one of the top 100 classic books.  I know that I have read it before but I forgot most of it so it was just as good the second time.  It is a book about a dystopian future, where people are categorized into castes and the highest caste lives a medicated life of ease.  There is one man who does not fit in and he is the central character.  A very good read but it is dark.",1,14
8,From Strength to Strength,Nancy Thorndike Greenspan,8/1/2023,8/5/2023,4,Patrick Kennedy,"My Friend Chris gave this to me after he retired.  It is an interesting read about the strengths and attributes that one brings into retirement, as well as discussions about the deficiencies associated with aging bring.  The discussion is around how to downshift from working into a productive life.  A good read.  I enjoyed it.",0,13
9,The Long Way,Bernhard Moitessier,10/1/2022,10/6/2022,4,Patrick Kennedy,"This is a book that was recommended to me by Paul when we were doing the Fall Off-Soundings race in 2022.  Paul is an interesting guy and this book was very interesting as well. It is about a French guy who sails in the first Golden Globe Race.  The race is a non-stop around the world race that was expected to last 8 or 9 months.  It is a well written story and goes into a lot of details about his sailing, supplies, mood changes, adventures and of course the weather.  There is a big surprise at what this guy does at the end of the race when it is likely that he is in first place and could win 5000 British Pounds.",0,6
